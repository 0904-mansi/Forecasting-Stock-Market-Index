# Forecasting-Stock-Market-Index

### As we know Stock Market prices are highly unpredictable and volatile. This means that there are no consistent patterns in the data that allow one to model stock prices over time near-perfectly. So, as a stock buyer you can reasonably decide when to buy stocks and when to sell them to make a profit. Instead of considering it a stochatic or random process and that there is no hope for machine learning. We are trying to model the data, so that the predictions one make correlate with the actual behavior of the data.This is where time series modelling comes in. You need good machine learning models that can look at the history of a sequence of data and correctly predict what the future elements of the sequence are going to be.
